# FlockingAlgorithmPython
My final project for my CS101 class. We had the choice to choose a project so I decided to recreate the flocking algorithm in Python

The P5 for python library was literally impossible to install. So if you wish to run this code, good luck because you'll need it.
P5PY library: https://github.com/p5py/p5
